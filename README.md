# Data with Code

A VLA40 exercise.

Old data can "rot". What we real mean by this is that the software has changed,
and despite that there is the once-fits-always-fits principle, it does not work.

The same actually applies to code. Compilers become more strict, and
old code needs to be clarified. The f77/g77/gfortran evolution has
shown this, the gnu C compiler has the -std= compiler flag, and Python
morphed from V2 to V3, with many subtle changes.
